# ASU Dining Hall Menu Bot

This is a Discord Bot that I created through Discord.py in order to scrape the menus at the various 
dining halls around ASU's campus and to paste them as a formatted Embed in a Discord channel



# Current Status

The current code that exists within "main.py" is my older version that would do a webscrape action
every time a user would submit a discord request. The new bot that I am optimizing in "test.py" does
a scrape every. day at 7 AM to store all the updated menus for the day to provide responses
faster for the users

The current implementation has working code for the Tooker and Manzanita Dinng Halls as well
as a semi working prototype for the Pitchforks Dining Hall.

I have paused my work on this project until the ASU 2023 Fall Semester starts in August as
the dining hall websites are currently inactive and will not be displaying menus until then.
